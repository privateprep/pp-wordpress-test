# PP Wordpress Test

A favor we do ourselves so upgrades and small tweaks don't cause regressions.

## Where are the tests?

Tests live in cypress/intergration/\*-spec.js

Are there holes? Absolutely. Fill 'em in!

## How does it run?

1. Clone repo
2. Run yarn install (install cypress if needed)
3. run `yarn run cypress:open` <-- opens up UI
4. run `yarn run cypress:run` <-- runs from command line
